Aviato - a ReAct-based system for exploring and planning travel
Submission for Purplefish take-home assignment project

-------------------------
Notes/Assumptions
* Scope of the tool - I'm choosing to focus this system on the domain of travel as opposed to being a fully open chat agent
Reasons:
* ChatGPT already exists, and it's less interesting to attempt a rebuild of another general purpose system
* Given the directive to use 3 or more specific tools, accessing public APIs, such as for weather or stock data, this feels like a chance to do a deep-dive into a choice of domain instead of reinventing GPT

Architecture decision:
* I'm choosing to configure this tool to run as a Docker image
Reasons:
* In order to ensure this will run on another system besides my own, I'll develop and test it within a Docker container, so I'll know that run with the same behavior elsewhere

Framework decisions:
* Rails
* NextJS
Reasons:
* Personal familiarity
* Availability of tools for rapid prototype development (rails new app-name, etc)
